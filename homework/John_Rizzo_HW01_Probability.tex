\textbf{Problem 1.1}

Jerry and Susan have a joint bank account.

Jerry goes to the bank 20\% of the days.

Susan goes there 30\% of the days.

Together they are at the bank 8\% of the days.

$P(B_j) = .20$

$P(B_s) = .30$

$P(B_j \cap B_s) = .08$

\textbf{a}

$P(B_j|B_s) = \frac{P(B_j \cap B_s)}{P(B_s)} = \frac{.08}{.30} = 0.2667 = 27\%$

\textbf{b}

$P(B_s') = 1 - P(B_s) = 1 - .30 = .70$

The probability that Jerry goes to the bank and not Susan

$P(B_j \cap B_s') = P(B_j) - P(B_j \cap B_s) = .20 - .08 = .12$

The probability that Jerry was at the bank given Susan didn't go

$P(B_j|B_s') = \frac{P(B_j \cap B_s')}{P(B_s')} = \frac{.12}{.70} = 0.1714 = 17.14\%$

\textbf{c}

At least one 

$P(B_j \cup B_s) = P(B_j) + P(B_s) - P(B_j \cap B_s) = .20 + .30 - .08 = .42 = 42\%$

Probability that both go is $P(B_j \cap B_s) = .08 = 8\%$

\hfill

\noindent
\textbf{Problem 1.2}

Harold and Sharon are studying for a test.

Harold's chances of getting a "B", $P(B_h)$, are 80\%.

Sharon's chances of getting a "B", $P(B_s)$ are 90\%.

The probability of at least one of them getting a "B", $P(B_h \cup B_s$), is 91\%.

$P(B_h) = .80$

$P(B_s) = .90$

$P(B_h \cup B_s) = .91$

$P(B_h \cup B_s) = P(B_h) + P(B_s) - P(B_h \cap B_s)$ 

$.91 = .80 + .90 - P(B_h \cap B_s) = 0.79 = 79\%$

$P(B_h \cap B_s) = .80 + .90 - .91 = .79 = 79\%$

\hfill

\textbf{a} $P(B_h) - P(B_h \cap B_s) = .80 - .79 = .01 = 1\%$

\hfill

\textbf{b} $P(B_s) - P(B_h \cap B_s) = .90 - .79 = .11 = 11\%$

\hfill

\textbf{c} $1 - P(B_h' \cup B_s') = 1 - .91 = .09 = 9\%$

\textbf{Problem 1.3}

The events are dependent events because $P(B_j \cap B_s) \neq P(B_j)P(B_s)$

$P(B_j) = .2 = 20\%$

$P(B_s) = .3 = 30\%$

$P(B_j \cap B_s) = 0.08 = 8\%$

$P(B_j)P(B_s) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 = 6\%$

$0.08 \neq 0.06$

\textbf{Problem 1.4}

\textbf{a} 

The events are dependent events because $P(A \cap B) \neq P(A)P(B)$

There are 36 possible combinations of 2 six sided die.

P(A) = sum is 6

P(B) = second die is 5

P(A) - Combinations include (5,1) (4,2) (3,3) (2,4) (1,5) so probability is $\frac{5}{36}$

P(B) - Combinations include (1,5) (2,5) (3,5) (4,5) (5,5) (6,5) so probability is $\frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$

$P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{36}$ because the only possible option is (1,5)

Solving 

P(A)P(B) = $\frac{5}{36} x \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{216}$

$P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{36}$ or if multiplied by 6 $\frac{6}{216}$

$P(A \cap B) \neq P(A)P(B)$

$\frac{1}{36}\neq\frac{6}{216}$ so they dependent

\textbf{b}

P(A) = The sum is 7

There are 36 possible combinations of two die

P(A) Possible combinations are (1,6) (2,5) (3,4) (4,3) (5,2) (6,1)

$P(A) = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$

P(B) = the first die shows 5.

P(B) possible combinations include (5,1) (5,2) (5,3) (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)

$P(B) = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$

$P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{36}$ since only (5,2) satisfies the criteria

$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$

$\frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{36}$

Since $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$ then they are independent.

\textbf{Problem 1.5}

Probability of Finding Choosing a State

Texas: $P(TX) = 0.6$

New Jersey: $P(NJ) = 0.1$

Alaska: $P(AK) = 0.3$ since the total must be 1

Probability of Finding Oil

Texas: $P(Oil|TX) = 0.3$

New Jersey: $P(Oil|NJ) = 0.1$

Alaska: $P(Oil|AK) = 0.2$

\textbf{1}

Using the law of Total Probability

$P(Oil) = P(TX)P(Oil|TX) + P(NJ)P(Oil|NJ) + P(AK)P(Oil|AK)$

$P(Oil) = (0.6)(0.3)     + (0.1)(0.1)     + (0.3)(0.2)$

$P(Oil) = 0.18           + 0.01           + 0.06 = 0.25 = 25\%$

\textbf{2}

Using Bayes' Theorem

$P(TX|Oil) = \frac{P(Oil|TX)P(TX)}{P(Oil)} = \frac{(0.3)(0.6)}{0.25} = \frac{0.18}{0.25} = 0.72 = 72\%$

\textbf{Problem 1.6}

Total Passengers: 2201

The probability that a passenger did not survive.

$\frac{1490}{2201} = 0.68 = 68\%$

The probability that a passenger was staying in the first class.

$\frac{325}{2201} = 0.15 = 15\%$

Given that a passenger survived, what is the probability that the passenger was staying in the first class.

$\frac{203}{711} = .29 = 29\%$

Are survival and staying in the first class independent?

$P(A) = P(Survival) = \frac{711}{2201} = 0.32 = 32\%$

$P(B) = P(1^{st} class) = \frac{325}{2201} = 0.15 = 15\%$

$P(A \cap B) = .29 = 29\%$

$P(A \cap B) \neq P(A) P(B)$

$29\% \neq 47\%$ therefor they are dependent.

Given that a passenger survived what is the probability that the passenger was staying in first class and the passenger was a child?

$\frac{6}{203} = 0.03 = 3\%$

Given that a passenger survived, what is the probability that the passenger was an adult?

$\frac{654}{711} = 0.92 = 92\%$

Given that a passenger survived, are age and staying in the first class independent?

Yes they are independent.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Accuracy = $\frac{TP + TN}{TP + FP + FN + TN} = \frac{970+930}{970+70+30+930} = \frac{1900}{2000} = 0.95 = 95\%$

Precision = $\frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \frac{970}{970 + 70} = \frac{970}{1040} = 0.93 = 93\%$

Recall = $\frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \frac{970}{970+30} = \frac{970}{1000} = 0.97 = 97\%$

F1 = $\frac{2 \times Precision \times Recall}{Precision + Recall} = \frac{2 (0.93)(0.97)}{(0.93)+(0.97)} = \frac{1.8042}{1.9} = 0.95 = 95\%$
